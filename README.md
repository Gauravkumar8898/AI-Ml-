### A simple implementation of a  Support Vector Machine model in python. The classifier is an object of the SVC class which was imported from sklearn.svm library.

the linear and rbf kernel type was choosen since this was a SVM classifier model and find which kernal is good for model accuracy.

### How to run project?

1) #### install the all requirement from requirement.txt
2) #### Run main.py file
3) #### see your output
